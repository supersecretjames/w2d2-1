# Write a chess game in an object-oriented way.
#
# There are many different kinds of pieces in chess, and each moves a specific way. How will you organize all of these different ways to move?
#
# A valid move also should not leave your king in check. Should the code to check this be in every one of your piece classes? Likewise, pawns can move diagonally to capture pieces (if present); how will you make them aware of other pieces on the board?
#
# You'll have to write logic that determines whether the game is won.
#
# Some kind of Game class should keep track of who's move it is, as well as the board, etc.
#
# You should not "bake in" the logic to prompt for a move into the game class; those concerns should be separated. You will want to write a HumanPlayer class. Don't implement a ComputerPlayer, but your design should allow that to be easily added at a later date.
#
# Note: Do not concern yourself with tricky moves like "en passant". Likewise, don't implement castling, draws, or pawn promotion; if you finish early work on other things. You should handle check and check mate, however.
